 Peer-to-Peer Cloud Gaming System

**A Prototype Whitepaper Exploring Decentralized, Token-Incentivized Game Streaming Using Shared CPU Power**

---

 About the Project

This project introduces a **peer-to-peer cloud gaming architecture** that allows users with low-end devices to play high-end games using distributed computing power contributed by the community. Inspired by blockchain systems and decentralized principles, the proposed model aims to democratize access to high-performance gaming.

The paper was structured in homage to Satoshi Nakamotoâ€™s legendary Bitcoin whitepaper.

 Core Idea

> Build a **platform of trust** where users **donate CPU time** in exchange for tokens. When they wish to play, they **spend tokens** to access distributed computing.  
> A secure, scalable system built for gamers, by gamers.
